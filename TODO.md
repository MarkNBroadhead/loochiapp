# Illumi Todo list


* -Restructure the app with a modal view at the beginning while we are trying to
reconnect to the last lamp that was used-
* Show a "lamp picker" if the last found lamp could not be found
* Make sure that the startup modal view works on iPad
* Make the color picker simpler: remove the gesture recognizer, add a segmented
button in the navbar to choose between white vs colors
* Add a tabbar and let the user switch from "static color" mode to IllumiNatur
* Write a first IllumiNature effect
